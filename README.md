# Docker Workshop

This is a practical workshop on using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for developing and deploying applications.

First of all, fork [this repository](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-docker):

```console
git clone https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-docker
cd workshop-docker/
```

And let's get going! ðŸš€

## Create a DockerHub Account

Sign up for a [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.
We will use it for exercises below.

## Remote VM Access

We are using a remote virtual machine on the NCIT cluster.
For that, follow the steps:

1. Connect to `fep.grid.pub.ro`:

   ```console
   ssh <your_upb_username>@fep.grid.pub.ro
   ```

1. Use instructions from instructors to connect to your virtual machine.

1. You will use the `student` user.
   The `student` user is able to run Docker on the virtual machine.
   The user also has full access to the system via `sudo`.
   The password for the `student` user is `student`.

## Inspect Docker Instances

Let's start with inspecting the Docker installation and instances on the virtual machine.

Follow the steps below:

1. See available `docker` commands:

   ```console
   docker help
   ```

1. Check the `docker` version:

   ```console
   docker version
   ```

1. See information about the `docker` installation:

   ```console
   docker info
   ```

1. Find out the currently running Docker containers:

   ```console
   docker ps
   ```

   You will the Docker containers that are currently running, namely an Nginx container:

   ```text
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                                     NAMES
   fbfe1d0b5870   nginx:latest   "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   6 hours ago   Up 38 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, [::]:8080->80/tcp   cdl-nginx
   ```

1. Find out all containers, including those that are stopped:

   ```console
   docker ps -a
   ```

   A new container, named `ctf-piece_of_pie` is now visible:

   ```text
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS                                     NAMES
   16a526c7c94c   ctf-piece_of_pie   "/usr/local/bin/run.â€¦"   24 minutes ago   Exited (137) 51 seconds ago                                             ctf-piece_of_pie
   fbfe1d0b5870   nginx:latest       "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   6 hours ago      Up 40 seconds                 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, [::]:8080->80/tcp   cdl-nginx
   ```

1. Find out port-related information about the `cdl-nginx` container that is running:

   ```console
   docker port cdl-nginx
   ```

   You can see the port forwarding:

   ```text
   80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8080
   80/tcp -> [::]:8080
   ```

   You can check the current install by querying the server:

   ```console
   curl localhost:8080
   ```

   You will see the default HTML page of Nginx.

   No information is shown for containers that are not running:

   ```console
   docker port ctf-piece_of_pie
   ```

1. Get detailed information about the Docker instances, either started or stopped:

   ```console
   docker inspect cdl-nginx
   docker inspect ctf-piece_of_pie
   ```

1. Find out of the runtime logging information of the container:

   ```console
   docker logs cdl-nginx
   docker logs ctf-piece_of_pie
   ```

1. Find out runtime statistics and resource consumption of the running Nginx container:

   ```console
   docker stats cdl-nginx
   ```

   Close the screen by running `Ctrl+c` three times.

1. Find out the internal processes of the running Nginx container:

   ```console
   docker top cdl-nginx
   ```

### Do It Yourself

Repeat the steps above, at least 2-3 times.

Now, let's use the steps above on different containers.
Start two new containers named `cdl-caddy` and `cdl-debian-bash` by running the corresponding scripts:

```console
./vanilla-caddy/run-caddy-container.sh
./debian-bash/run-debian-bash-container.sh
```

Inspect the two newly started containers using the commands above.

## Interact with Docker Instances

Let's now do actual interaction with Docker container instances.
Such as starting and stopping containers, copying files to / from containers, getting a shell inside containers etc.

Follow the steps below.

### Start Instances

Start the `ctf-piece_of_pie` instance:

```console
docker start ctf-piece_of_pie
```

Now check it is started:

```console
docker ps
```

You can see it appears as a started container.

Check the ports and the processes:

```console
docker port ctf-piece_of_pie
docker top ctf-piece_of_pie
```

Connect locally to test the service:

```console
nc localhost 31337
```

### Stop Instances

Stop the `cdl-nginx` instance:

```console
docker stop cdl-nginx
```

You can see it does not appear as a started container.

Check to see the list of stopped containers:

```console
docker ps -a
```

### Remove Containers

A stopped container can be removed.
Once this is done, the container is gone forever.
It will have to be re-instantiated if needed, as we'll see in section ["Images and Containers"](#images-and-containers).

Remove the `cdl-nginx` container:

```console
docker rm cdl-nginx
```

The container is now gone.
You can use different commands to see if is gone:

```console
docker ps -a
docker inspect cdl-nginx
docker stats cdl-nginx
```

### Connect to a Container

You can connect to a container by using `docker exec`.
Typically, you want to start a shell.
Start a shell on the `ctf-piece_of_pie` container by using

```console
docker exec -it ctf-piece_of_pie /bin/bash
```

More than that, you can run different commands inside the container:

```console
docker exec -it ctf-piece_of_pie ls
docker exec -it ctf-piece_of_pie ls /proc
docker exec -it ctf-piece_of_pie cat /etc/shadow
docker exec -it ctf-piece_of_pie id
```

### Copy Files To / From a Container

You can copy files or entire directories to or from a container.
For example, to copy the `README.md` file to the `cdl-nginx` container in the `root` directory, use:

```console
docker cp README.md cdl-nginx:/root/
```

Likewise, if we want to copy the `index.html` file we use:

```console
docker cp cdl-nginx:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html .
```

**Note**: There is a period (`.`) at the end of the command above.
It is required, it points to the current directory.

You can see that the container doesn't need to be running.

### Do It Yourself

Make sure all four containers are started: `cdl-nginx`, `ctf-piece_of_pie`, `cdl-caddy`, `cdl-debian-bash`.
Start them if they are not stared.

Copy files to and from containers.

1. Copy `README.md` and `install-docker.sh` files from the current directory in the `/usr/local/` directory in all containers available (via `docker ps -a`).

1. Copy the `ctf/` local directory in the `/usr/local/` directory in all containers available (via `docker ps -a`).

1. Create a directory for each available container:

   ```console
   mkdir container-cdl-nginx
   mkdir container-ctf-piece_of_pie
   mkdir container-cdl-caddy
   mkdir container-cdl-debian-bash
   ```

   Copy the `/bin/bash` binary from each available container to their respective directory.

   Copy the `/etc/os-release` file from each available container to their respective directory.
   Check the contents to see what Linux distro was used to construct the filesystem.

## Docker Images

Images are stored locally either by being pulled from a container registry such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) (see section ["Getting Images"](#getting-images)) or from a `Dockefile` (see section ["Dockerfile"](#dockerfile)).

List the available Docker images by using:

```console
docker image ls
```

You will get an output such as:

```text
REPOSITORY         TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ctf-piece_of_pie   latest     1f844c4f935b   9 hours ago    209MB
<none>             <none>     99ba2c76892a   9 hours ago    216MB
<none>             <none>     e81d4254c928   13 hours ago   209MB
<none>             <none>     2d74afaf7b34   13 hours ago   209MB
debian             bookworm   617f2e89852e   2 weeks ago    117MB
nginx              latest     3b25b682ea82   4 weeks ago    192MB
gcc                14.2       d0b5d902201b   3 months ago   1.42GB
```

The `<none>` entries store intermediary versions of an image file.

You can also inspect an image, such as `debian:bookworm`.

```console
docker image inspect debian:bookworm
```

## Images and Containers

As stated above, containers are created from images.
Let's re-create the Nginx container, starting from the `nginx:latest` image:

```console
docker create --rm --name cdl-nginx nginx:latest
```

Check out it was created by running:

```console
docker ps -a
```

The container is currently stopped.
In order to start the container, run:

```console
docker start cdl-nginx
```

Check out it was started by running:

```console
docker ps
docker logs cdl-nginx
docker inspect cdl-nginx
docker stats cdl-nginx
```

The create and start command can be combined in a single command, `docker run`.

Create two more Nginx containers by running `docker run`:

```console
docker run --rm --name cdl2-nginx -p 8882:80 nginx:latest
docker run --rm --name cdl3-nginx -p 8883:80 nginx:latest
```

Check whether they are running:

```console
docker ps
docker stats cdl2-nginx
docker stats cdl3-nginx
curl localhost:8882
curl localhost:8883
```

The `--rm` option will remove an Nginx instance once it is stopped.

Stop the instances:

```console
docker stop cdl2-nginx
docker stop cdl3-nginx
```

Now the containers are gone forever (because of the `--rm` option):

```console
docker ps -a
```

### Do It Yourself

Create more Nginx instances from available images:

1. Use `docker run` to create 5 more Nginx images from the `nginx:latest` image.
   Make sure you use different public ports.

   Use the `--rm` option of `docker run`.

1. Stop the containers you have just started.

1. Check they are gone forever.

## Getting Images

Images are stored locally either by being pulled from a container registry such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd) (see section ["Getting Images"](#getting-images)) or from a `Dockefile` (see section ["Dockerfile](#dockerfile)).

To search for an image you like, use the commands below:

```console
docker search database
```

To pull images locally, use:

```console
docker pull <container-image-name-and-path-in-regitry>
```

such as:

```console
docker pull nginx:latest
docker pull gcc:14.2
```

### Do It Yourself

Download and instantiate other images.

1. Download images the applications: [MongoDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo), [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb).
   Use the names `mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest` and `mariadb:latest`.

1. Create 5 container instances for `MongoDB` and 5 container instances for `MariaDB`.
   Use the `--rm` option for `docker run`.

1. Check to see the container instances are running.

1. After a while, stop the newly instances.

## Installing Docker

Install Docker Engine following the [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
We recommend that you install Docker inside of a Linux Virtual Machine if you're running on Windows so that you can take advantage of its CLI features.

Use either [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or the Intro to Operating Systems [Virtual Machine](https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/uso/USO.ova) if you you with to run in a Linux VM.

Make sure to add your user to the `docker` group so you can run the docker commands without `sudo`.
See the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

As a quick way to install Docker for Debian-based systems, follow the instructions below, also listed in the `install-nginx.sh` script:

```console
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get -yqq update
sudo apt-get -yqq install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get -yqq update

sudo apt-get -yqq install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo adduser $USER docker
```

## Dockerfile

Dockerfiles provide recipes for creating images.
The images can then be instantiated into containers.

### Check Dockerfiles

Check the [`Dockerfile` used by the `ctf-piece-of-pie` container](ctf-piece_of_pie/deploy/Dockerfile).

Also check the following Dockerfiles:

- [`linux-kernel-labs`](https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux/blob/master/tools/labs/docker/kernel/Dockerfile) defines a Docker container.
- [`uso-lab`](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/uso-lab/blob/master/labs/03-user/lab-container/fizic/Dockerfile)
- [`dropbox`](https://github.com/Sergiu121/uso-lab/blob/master/labs/09-task-admin/lab-container/dropbox/Dockerfile)

This is a brief overview of the main keywords in a `Dockerfile`:

- `FROM` - the base container on top of which the setup will be done;
- `RUN` - runs a setup command;
- `WORKDIR` - sets the container work directory to the specific path;
- `USER` - sets the running user to the specific username;
- `ARG` - defines an argument at build time;
- `COPY` - copies a file from the build directory to the container.

[The Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) presents an extensive presentation of keywords in a `Dockerfile`.

### Build Images from Dockerfiles

All four Dockerfiles presented above are part of the `dockerfile/` directory.
Let's use them to create Docker images:

1. Build the CTF Docker image:

   ```console
   docker build -f dockerfile/ctf.Dockerfile -t my-ctf ctf/
   ```

   The options in the above command are:

   - `-f dockerfile/ctf.Dockerfile`: the path to the `Dockerfile` used to build the image
   - `-t my-ctf`: the image name (also called a tag)
   - `ctf/`: the directory that will be used as the base for `COPY` commands

   Running the command above results in the creation of the `my-ctf` image.

1. Build the `linux-kernel-labs` Docker image:

   ```console
   docker build -f dockerfile/linux-kernel-labs.Dockerfile -t linux-kernel-labs .
   ```

   Running the command above results in an error:

   ```text
   => ERROR [32/36] RUN groupadd -g $ARG_GID ubuntu
   ------
    > [32/36] RUN groupadd -g $ARG_GID ubuntu:
   0.207 groupadd: invalid group ID 'ubuntu'
   ------
   linux-kernel-labs.Dockerfile:42
   --------------------
     40 |     ARG ARG_GID
     41 |
     42 | >>> RUN groupadd -g $ARG_GID ubuntu
   ```

   This is caused by missing build arguments `ARG_UID` and `ARG_GID`.
   We provide these arguments via the `--build-arg` option:

   ```console
   docker build -f dockerfile/linux-kernel-labs.Dockerfile --build-arg ARG_GID=$(id -g) --build-arg ARG_UID=$(id -u) -t linux-kernel-labs .
   ```

   Running the command above results in the creation of the `linux-kernel-labs` image.

1. Build the `uso-lab` Docker image:

   ```console
   docker build -f dockerfile/uso-lab.Dockerfile -t uso-lab .
   ```

   Running the command above results in an error:

   ```text
    => ERROR [15/16] COPY ./run.sh /usr/local/bin/run.sh
   ------
    > [15/16] COPY ./run.sh /usr/local/bin/run.sh:
   ------
   uso-lab.Dockerfile:20
   --------------------
     18 |     RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
     19 |
     20 | >>> COPY ./run.sh /usr/local/bin/run.sh
     21 |     CMD ["run.sh"]
   ```

   This is because the [`run.sh` script](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/uso-lab/blob/master/labs/03-user/lab-container/fizic/run.sh) is not available in the local filesystem.
   You will fix that as a task below.

1. Build the `dropbox` Docker image:

   ```console
   docker build -f dockerfile/dropbox.Dockerfile -t dropbox .
   ```

   Running the command above results in a similar error as above:

   ```text
   => ERROR [9/9] COPY ./run.sh /usr/local/bin/run.sh
   ------
    > [9/9] COPY ./run.sh /usr/local/bin/run.sh:
   ------
   dropbox.Dockerfile:80
   --------------------
     78 |
     79 |     # Install init script and dropbox command line wrapper
     80 | >>> COPY ./run.sh /usr/local/bin/run.sh
     81 |     CMD ["run.sh"]
   ```

   This is because the [`run.sh` script](https://github.com/Sergiu121/uso-lab/blob/master/labs/09-task-admin/lab-container/dropbox/run.sh) is not available in the local filesystem.
   You will fix that as a task below.

#### Do It Yourself

##### Fix Build Issue

First, fix the issue with the creation of the `uso-lab` image.
That is:

1. Copy the [`run.sh` script](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/uso-lab/blob/master/labs/03-user/lab-container/fizic/run.sh) locally.

1. Run the `docker build` command again.
   Be sure to pass the correct path as the final argument to the `docker build` command.
   This is the path where the `run.sh` script is located locally.

Follow similar steps to fix the issue with the creation of the `dropbox` image.

##### Images from Other Dockerfiles

Search the Internet (GitHub or otherwise) for two Dockerfiles.
Build images from those two Dockerfiles.

### Python Server

Go to the `python-server` directory and build the container using the following command:

```console
docker build -t python-server:1.0 .
```

The command builds the container with the specification from the `Dockerfile`.
Test the container functionality by running:

```console
curl localhost:8080
```

Change the base image to Debian and rebuild the container tagged with the `python-server-debian:1.0` tag.

Create a `Makefile` with has the following rules:

- `build`: creates a new image using the `Dockerfile`;
- `start`: starts a container based on the `python-server` image named `python-workspace` in the background;
- `stop`: stops the `python-workspace` container;
- `connect`: connects to the container in an interactive shell.

### Assignment Checker

A common use case for using containers is platform-agnostic testing.
The `assignment-checker` directory contains a bash scripts which runs tests on an application by running it and comparing its output with a reference.

Create a Docker image which is able to run this script, compile de application and run the tests.

## Volumes

While it makes sense to run Docker containers by themselves as services, all the data that they produce is ephemeral and will be deleted when the container is destroyed.

To provide an input to the containers and a permanent storage for them we use volumes.

Volumes are used to save outputs of files permanently. Start a container based on the image you can build and call `infinite-wrier`in the background using the following command:

```console
docker run -d --name perpetual-writer -v perpetual-storage:/var/perpetual-storage -t perpetual-writer
```

Stop it and remove it.
Start a new container based on the same image using the same command.
Enter the container and check the content of the `/perpetual-storage/logs` file.

The files are still stored on disk but in the `/var/lib/docker` directory.
To find local mount point of the volume run the `docker volume inspect` command.
List the content of that directory.

Run the scripts in `TODO`.
Identify for each container what volume it is using and what is the path to that volume on disk.
There are three containers.

### Bind mounts

Bind volumes mount files or directories from the host to a path in the container.

We will be running the `nginx` container using content on our host system.
The command to do this from the repository root is:

```console
docker run --name better-nginx -v $PWD/nginx-website:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx
```

The `nginx-website` directory is mounted to the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory.
Change the above command to mount the `better-website` directory instead.
See what has changed.

Add an additional mount point to the above command to mount the `nginx-confs/nginx.conf` file as the Nginx configuration file fount at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

#### Build Program With GCC13

An advantage of using containers is the fact that they offer a flexible environment for testing and building applications.
Based on [this](https://gitlab.cs.pub.ro/operating-systems/assignments-docker-base/-/blob/main/Dockerfile?ref_type=heads) Dockerfile, create a Docker image which compiles an application based based on a `Makefile` located in the `/workdir` path.

The container must be able to compile applications using GCC13.

The application to be compiled is located in `assignment-checker/src`.
Use the included `Makefile` to compile it.

## Container Registries

Now that we have created a set of containers, we want to publish them so they are available to the world and to download on other systems.

To push the `python-container` image that we have built earlier, we will need to tag it so that it has an associated namespace as such:

```console
docker tag python-container:1.0 <dockerhub-username>/python-container:1.0
```

Where `dockerhub-username` is your DockerHub username.

To push the container you will use the `docker push command`:

```container
docker push <dockerhub-username>/python-container:1.0
```

Tag the `assignment-checker` container and push it to DockerHub.

### Using GitHub Container Registry

While using DockerHub offers great visibility for projects and container images, it limits the number of pulls for images on a specific IP.
To bypass this issue we will create a GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) account and login to it.

Follow the [GHCR tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry) to create a GHCR account.

Login to the account the same as you did with the DockerHub account and tag the `assignment-checker` image to be pushed to GHCR.
